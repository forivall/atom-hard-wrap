NOTICE: I'm no longer using atom as my primary text editor, so I'm not really
maintaining this anymore. I'll still review PRs, and if someone wants to take
over, I'll give you the commit bit. Thanks for using atom-hard-wrap!

# Hard-wrap package

Format the current selection to have lines no longer than 80 characters using
<kbd>cmd/ctrl-alt-y</kbd>. If nothing is selected, the current paragraph will be
reflowed.

This packages uses the config value of `editor.preferredLineLength` when set.
When the multi-wrap-guide package is used, then the currently set column guide
is used.
